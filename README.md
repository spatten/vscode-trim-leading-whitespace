# trim-leading-whitespace README

This extension adds one command: "Trim Leading Whitespace". This command takes the current selection and trims leading whitespace from it.

E.g. it takes this:

```
  This has two leading spaces
    This has four leading spaces
   This has three leading spaces
```

And removes two leading spaces from every line.

To use it, select some text and then type "trim leading whitespace" in the command palette.
